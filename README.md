# Boost.SQLite Review

### Review letter (paste-ready)

- Read the letter: https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/main/submission.md
- Text-only review letter: https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/main/submission_letter.txt

**Reviewer:** Sergio DuBois  
**Scope:** 1–2 pages focused on API design/ergonomics, feature coverage, docs clarity, and competitor context.  
**Comparators:** SQLiteCpp, sqlite_modern_cpp, sqlite_orm (ORM perspective), SOCI (multi-DB abstraction).

> **Disclosure:** Prepared under the sponsorship of the C++ Alliance with assistance from AI tools; final edits and judgments are human-curated.  
> **Methodology:** High-level summary below; full detail in section 6 of `submission.md`. Evidence links live in `evidence/` and the comparison snapshot lives in `comparison/`.

## Executive Overview

- Strengths: dual-path error handling (exceptions and error_code), RAII transactions/savepoints, rich extensibility (custom functions, aggregates, virtual tables, hooks), and integration with Boost.JSON/variant.
- Trade-offs: packaging not yet in major managers; adoption currently via source/CMake.
- Landscape: compared with SQLiteCpp, sqlite_modern_cpp, sqlite_orm, and SOCI to clarify positioning and design trade-offs.
- Licensing: Boost Software License; favorable for corporate use versus MIT attribution or AGPL.

## Deliverables

- `submission.md` — paste-ready text for the Boost review mailing list thread.
- `submission_letter.txt` — full text-only review letter (email-ready).
- `comparison/feature-matrix.csv` — a small, auditable snapshot of differences.
- `evidence/EvidenceLog.csv` + `evidence/sources.md` — links & notes for claims.

## Methodology (high level)

- Cursor-driven drafting informed by domain prompts and deep-research intake; interim workproducts refined with human-in-the-loop curation and targeted red-team passes.
- Evidence-first: only evidence-backed matrix entries; unresolved items marked `TODO` or `[VERIFY]` until sourced. Dates and links captured in `evidence/`.
- Scope: Option A (light comparison). Any optional probes are isolated under `micro-probe/`.

## Contributing

- Discussion is welcome on the Boost review list.
- Repository feedback via issues/PRs is appreciated (typos, clarifications, evidence additions).

# Methodology & Disclosure

- **Goal:** Option A (light comparison) suitable for a Boost re-review submission within the announced window.
- **Process:** 
  1) Intake: drop raw Deep Research text files into `evidence/deep-research/intake/`.
  2) Curate: summarize into `evidence/deep-research/curated/` using templates; add dated links and ≤25‑word quotes.
  3) Log: append each cited source to `evidence/sources.md` and `evidence/EvidenceLog.csv`.
  4) Matrix: fill `comparison/feature-matrix.csv` only with claims supported by `evidence/`.
  5) Draft: update `submission.md` (abstain/no‑vote) with compact findings referencing the matrix.
  6) Red‑team: verify each non‑obvious claim maps to a first‑party source; prune speculative phrasing.
- **AI assistance:** AI used for drafting structure and summarization; final judgments and the explicit vote are human decisions.
- **Limitations:** No performance benchmarking beyond what is documented by first-party sources; avoid relative performance claims without concrete, reproducible evidence.

# Methodology & Disclosure

- **Goal:** Option A (light comparison) suitable for a Boost re-review submission within the announced window.
- **Process:** 
  1) Collect first-party docs/READMEs for Boost.SQLite and comparators (SQLiteCpp, sqlite_modern_cpp, sqlite_orm, SOCI).
  2) Fill `comparison/feature-matrix.csv` **only** with claims supported by `evidence/` links. Mark any uncertain cells as TODO.
  3) Draft `submission.md` using neutral, Boost-standards-focused language.
  4) Red-team pass: check that each non-obvious claim maps to a source; prune subjective phrasing.
- **AI assistance:** AI used for drafting structure and summarization; final judgments and the explicit vote are human decisions.
- **Limitations:** No performance benchmarking beyond what is documented by first-party sources; avoid relative performance claims without concrete, reproducible evidence.

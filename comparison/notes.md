# Comparison Notes (how to read the matrix)

- Cells marked **[VERIFY]** are seeded expectations. Replace them only after checking the official docs/README of each library.  
- Keep the scope aligned with Option A (light comparison). Avoid deep performance claims unless first-party and clearly scoped.
- If evidence is missing, leave the cell blank and add a TODO in this file rather than guessing.
- Treat `sqlite_orm` as an ORM layer (a different category) and explain trade-offs succinctly.

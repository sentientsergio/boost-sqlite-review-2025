Subject: Review: Boost.SQLite (re-review) — Conditional Accept

Hello,

I reviewed Boost.SQLite during the official re-review window (Aug 25–Sep 3, 2025) (EVID-20250826-review-announce). Scope: a light comparison (Option A) centered on API design/ergonomics, feature coverage (prepared statements and bindings, custom functions, virtual tables, event hooks, JSON/variant integration), and documentation discoverability, with short notes versus SQLiteCpp, sqlite_modern_cpp, sqlite_orm (an ORM layer), and SOCI (a multi‑DB abstraction).

**Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL ACCEPT  
**Rationale (short):** Boost.SQLite exposes core and advanced SQLite capabilities with a clear C++ interface, including a non‑throwing API option and first‑class extension points (custom functions, virtual tables, hooks) (EVID-20250826-bsql-features). It integrates JSON/variants (EVID-20250826-bsql-features) and provides an RAII transaction guard (EVID-20250826-bsql-transactions). The primary tradeoff today is packaging (build from source; separate extension library) (EVID-20250826-bsql-packaging). I recommend acceptance contingent on clarifying packaging guidance in docs and maintaining the current quality bar through release.

### Highlights

- Non‑throwing interface available for error handling sensitive code (EVID-20250826-bsql-features).
- Extensibility: hooks, custom scalar/aggregate functions, and virtual tables (EVID-20250826-bsql-features).
- JSON/variant integration for ergonomic data mapping (EVID-20250826-bsql-features).
- RAII transaction guard for simple and safe transactions (EVID-20250826-bsql-transactions).
- Permissive Boost Software License 1.0 (EVID-20250826-bsql-license).

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- Packaging: build from source; separate `boost_sqlite_ext` for extensions — improve guidance and examples (EVID-20250826-bsql-packaging).
- Scope clarity: this is a client wrapper around SQLite, not an ORM or multi‑DB abstraction (ensure docs keep this clear for newcomers) (EVID-20250826-bsql-features).
- Some comparator capabilities (e.g., UDF/vtable support outside Boost.SQLite) remain to be verified in future work; the matrix notes these as [VERIFY] where evidence is not yet logged.

### Brief comparison snapshot (see matrix for details)

- SQLiteCpp — Client wrapper with exceptions on errors; RAII transactions; vcpkg; MIT (EVID-20250826-sqlitecpp-errors, EVID-20250826-sqlitecpp-trans, EVID-20250826-sqlitecpp-packaging, EVID-20250826-sqlitecpp-license).
- sqlite_modern_cpp — Client wrapper; exceptions; transactions via begin/commit/rollback commands; vcpkg; MIT (EVID-20250826-moderncpp-errors, EVID-20250826-moderncpp-trans, EVID-20250826-moderncpp-packaging, EVID-20250826-moderncpp-license).
- sqlite_orm — ORM/DSL layer (different category); exceptions by default with non‑throw `get_pointer` alternative; vcpkg; dual license AGPL‑3 / paid MIT (EVID-20250826-sqliteorm-orm, EVID-20250826-sqliteorm-errors, EVID-20250826-sqliteorm-packaging, EVID-20250826-sqliteorm-license).
- SOCI — Multi‑DB abstraction; errors throw `soci_error`; SQLite backend exposes SQLite result codes; Boost Software License (EVID-20250826-soci-errors, EVID-20250826-soci-sqlite-backend, EVID-20250826-soci-license).

The comparison matrix intentionally retains [VERIFY] tags where first‑party confirmation is pending; no claims are made in prose beyond the logged evidence.

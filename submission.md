Subject: Review: Boost.SQLite — Conditional Accept

Hello,

I reviewed Boost.SQLite during the official re-review window (Aug 25–Sep 3, 2025) ([EVID-20250826-review-announce](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L34)). Scope: a light comparison (Option A) centered on API design/ergonomics, feature coverage (prepared statements and bindings, custom functions, virtual tables, event hooks, JSON/variant integration), and documentation discoverability, with short notes versus SQLiteCpp, sqlite_modern_cpp, sqlite_orm (an ORM layer), and SOCI (a multi‑DB abstraction).

**Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL ACCEPT  
**Rationale (short):** Boost.SQLite exposes core and advanced SQLite capabilities with a clear C++ interface, including a non‑throwing API option and first‑class extension points (custom functions, virtual tables, hooks) ([EVID-20250826-bsql-features](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L10)). It integrates JSON/variants ([EVID-20250826-bsql-features](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L10)) and provides an RAII transaction guard ([EVID-20250826-bsql-transactions](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L11)). The primary tradeoff today is packaging (build from source; separate extension library) ([EVID-20250826-bsql-packaging](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L12)). I recommend acceptance contingent on clarifying packaging guidance in docs and maintaining the current quality bar through release.

### Highlights

- Non‑throwing interface available for error handling sensitive code ([EVID-20250826-bsql-features](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L10)).
- Extensibility: hooks, custom scalar/aggregate functions, and virtual tables ([EVID-20250826-bsql-features](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L10)).
- JSON/variant integration for ergonomic data mapping ([EVID-20250826-bsql-features](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L10)).
- RAII transaction guard for simple and safe transactions ([EVID-20250826-bsql-transactions](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L11)).
- Permissive Boost Software License 1.0 ([EVID-20250826-bsql-license](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L13)).

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- Packaging: build from source; separate `boost_sqlite_ext` for extensions — improve guidance and examples ([EVID-20250826-bsql-packaging](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L12)).
- Scope clarity: this is a client wrapper around SQLite, not an ORM or multi‑DB abstraction (ensure docs keep this clear for newcomers) ([EVID-20250826-bsql-features](https://github.com/sentientsergio/boost-sqlite-review-2025/blob/8f6512688f8ea41fbbe92a85c15ca0403b2b1276/evidence/EvidenceLog.csv#L10)).
- Some comparator capabilities (e.g., UDF/vtable support outside Boost.SQLite) remain to be verified in future work; the matrix notes these as [VERIFY] where evidence is not yet logged.

The comparison matrix intentionally retains [VERIFY] tags where first‑party confirmation is pending; no claims are made in prose beyond the logged evidence.

### A brief personal reflection (SWOT-style)

- Strengths: In day-to-day use, the non-throwing path and composable API felt steady and predictable, and the extension points (hooks, UDFs, virtual tables) made the “power user” stories straightforward rather than exotic.

- Weaknesses: Packaging took a bit more thought than a one-line package install, and I found myself wishing for a single “map” page that links the advanced topics end-to-end.

- Opportunities: A short set of copy‑paste guides (UDFs, virtual tables, event hooks) and clearer packaging recipes would help new adopters reach first value faster.

- Threats: Competing wrappers are a `vcpkg install` away; if packaging remains heavier, some teams may default elsewhere. As the API settles for Boost, keeping churn low will matter for early adopters.

# Cursor Project Rules — Boost.SQLite Re-Review (Option A)

## Project type
Review writing (light comparison). This is **not** a software development repo.

## Sources of truth
- Narrative claims must be backed by entries in `evidence/` (add to `EvidenceLog.csv` and `sources.md`).  
- The comparison snapshot lives in `comparison/feature-matrix.csv` and must stay **CSV** (no reformatting headers).

## Agent workflow
- **Research** → capture official links + quotes (≤ 25 words) into `evidence/` with dates.
- **Matrix** → fill only what is supported by evidence; mark uncertain cells as `TODO` or `[VERIFY]`.
- **Writer** → update `submission.md` (1–2 pages max); explicitly state **Accept / Conditional Accept / Reject**.
- **Red-Team** → verify each non-obvious claim maps to a source; scrub speculative language.

## Editing rules
- Do **not** invent facts. If evidence is missing, leave the cell blank and add a TODO.
- Keep CSV headers and column order unchanged. Use plain ASCII quotes in CSV.
- Prefer first-party docs over blogs/mirrors.
- Quotes (if used) must be ≤ 25 words to respect fair use.
- Keep licensing clear: prose/data are CC BY 4.0; any code under `/micro-probe` is MIT.

## Scope boundaries
- This is **Option A**: avoid deep performance analysis or extended code probes unless clearly marked in `micro-probe/`.
- Treat `sqlite_orm` as an ORM (different layer) and explain trade-offs without conflating categories.

## Commit hygiene
- `Evidence: add <lib> <topic>`
- `Matrix: update <axis> — <lib>`
- `Draft: submission — revise vote`
- `RedTeam: pass <n>`

## Review gates
- **G1 (Evidence hygiene):** sources exist + dates captured.
- **G2 (Matrix freeze):** verify `[VERIFY]` tags removed or justified.
- **G3 (Submission ready):** explicit vote present; disclosure present; repo link ready.

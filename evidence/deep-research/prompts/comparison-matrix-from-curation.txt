OBJECTIVE
From curated deep-research docs, produce a comparison CSV that matches comparison/feature-matrix.csv headers exactly.

INPUTS
1) Curated domain explainer and Boost.SQLite deep dive (plain text)
2) Curated competitor overviews for the top four (plain text)
3) The existing matrix headers:
Axis,Boost.SQLite,SQLiteCpp,sqlite_modern_cpp,sqlite_orm,SOCI,Notes

DELIVERABLE (PLAIN TEXT ONLY)
- Emit only a CSV body (including header) using the exact columns above.
- Populate cells only with claims supported by curated inputs; otherwise leave blank or add TODO/[VERIFY].
- Keep ASCII quotes and commas; no Markdown.

GUIDANCE
- Use concise, neutral phrasing (e.g., "Exceptions", "Non-throwing interface").
- Prefer identifiers when appropriate (e.g., type/function names) in Notes.
- Do not invent facts; prefer blank + TODO over speculation.
- If a competitor differs from the five columns, still fill what you can; do not add columns.
